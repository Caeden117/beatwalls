# beatwalls

commandline tool to add Walls to beatsaber maps using bookmarks

## Installation
- have java installed

- Download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/spookyGh0st/beatwalls/releases) tab

# CURRENT VERSION IS A MESS, BACK UP EVERYTHING

## Usage

_IMPORTANT:_ every value scales to the block size. So a wall with a height of 1 will be one block high. You can use odd values for precise walls.

write one or more command in a bookmark at the time you want to take effect. The given parameters (exept scale) are added to the default parameters.
The Syntax is:

/bw NAME duration wallHeight startHeight lineOffset width startTime Scale

- name: The name of the pattern you want to use

- duration: The duration of each Wall in beats.

- wallHeight: height of each wall.

- startHeight: StartHeight of each wall

- lineOffset: How many blocks a wall will be shifted.  __IMPORTANT:__ 0 is the Center (so original 0 would be -2)

- width: The width of each wall

- Scale: How much you want to Scale The WHOLE pattern. DOES ONLY AFFECT DURATION AND TIMING. for example 2 would scale the whole pattern to double the size, 0.5 would scale it half the size


Then just drag whole Song folder or a difficulty On the programm.
## Roadmap
