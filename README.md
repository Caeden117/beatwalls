# beatwalls

commandline tool to add Walls to beatsaber maps using bookmarks. [showcase](https://streamable.com/felde)

## Installation
- have java installed

- Download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/spookyGh0st/beatwalls/releases) tab

- This program works with bookmarks, which are currently only supported by Mediocre Mapper or json editing. So you need that.

# BACK UP EVERYTHING

## Usage

Please read the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/spookyGh0st/beatwalls/wiki) for a detailed Tutorial on how to use them

- you have to add a bookmark with your chosen commands at the Beat you want your walls to be. 
one command consists of 

`/bw $name $scale $repeatCount $repeatGap $PARAMETERS`

- Then just drag whole song folder on the beatwalls.exe. It will automatically create the BeatwallAsset File the first time it is run.
_(or open it in a cli)_

***WARNING*** by default this will delete all previous obstacles. Look at the help page, if you want to keep them


## Plans

1.0 Create a working program with some decent example files.

later: create a text walls, create a converter from original obstacle to my layout, add more Structures.
